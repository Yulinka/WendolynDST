Wendolyn was created as the other half of my June 2017 birthday gift to my partner [![steam icon](http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/90/90c691376873c50ce628a43a2eec2a5331d41110_medium.jpg "Keidence")][Keidence]. :heart:

Wendolyn represents my pet obsessed, slightly insane/oddball characteristics wrapped up into a creepy-cute girl.

All assets, artwork, sound files were made by me.

All programming and mechanics were made by [Keidence][].
